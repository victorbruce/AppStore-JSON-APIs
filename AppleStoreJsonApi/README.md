#  AppleStoreJsonApi

A tutorial course by **Brain Voong** from Let's Build That App(LBTA) on how to fetch asynchronous data and work with collection views to build complex layouts.

### Core Concepts I learned:

- UICollectionViews
- UITabBarController
- UISearchController
- UIStackViewController
- Json Decodable
- Aysnchronous Data Fetch
- DispatchGroup Syncing
- Custom Animations
- SDWebImage Caching
- Snapping Flow Layout
- Generics

### Project Structure:

- Service: holds all logic relating to network requests
- Model: holds a list of constructed models for representing data
- Views: holds a list of reusable or standalone views used across the app
- Controllers: holds all view controllers
